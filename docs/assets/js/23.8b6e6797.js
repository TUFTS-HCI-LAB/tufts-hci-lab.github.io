Some examples of the implications for the design of this work are found in such previous experimental fNIRS-based systems as: Brainput for robot automation, air traffic control, music learning, and bubble cursor usage. We provide a new fNIRS dataset collected using rigorous procedures from subjects performing a standard n-back cognitive task and show how it can be used to improve performance for future systems. We developed a new machine learning approach to process and utilize fNIRS data. We show from our experiments that our proposed 3-phase machine learning pipeline significantly improves n-back task classification performance over several established baselines. Moreover, even with a reduced amount of per-user training data, our approach still outperforms baseline models trained with all available target-subject-specific training data, showing the potential of reducing individual calibration effort when deploying BCI applications in the future. We hope that our new dataset, machine learning method, and tools will remove barriers that have prevented a wider range of researchers from using fNIRS-based BCI and facilitate the development of a new generation of powerful and easy use brain-computer interfaces.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"code"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#code"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Code")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/lwang89/code_for_UIST.git",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Here is the link to our code Github repo"),a("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"dataset"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#dataset"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Dataset")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"paper-link-and-please-cite"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#paper-link-and-please-cite"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Paper link and Please Cite")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/papers/uist21.pdf",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Paper link"),a("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),a("h3",{attrs:{id:"bibtex"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#bibtex"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Bibtex")]),e._v(" "),a("div",{staticClass:"language- extra-class"},[a("pre",{pre:!0,attrs:{class:"language-text"}},[a("code",[e._v("@inproceedings{wang2021taming,\n  title={Taming fNIRS-based BCI input for better calibration and broader use},\n  author={Wang, Liang and Huang, Zhe and Zhou, Ziyu and McKeon, Devon and Blaney, Giles and Hughes, Michael C and Jacob, Robert JK},\n  booktitle={The 34th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology},\n  pages={179--197},\n  year={2021}\n}\n@inproceedings{huangfNIRS2MW2021,\n    title = {The Tufts fNIRS Mental Workload Dataset & Benchmark for Brain-Computer Interfaces that Generalize},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks},\n    author = {Huang, Zhe and Wang, Liang and Blaney, Giles and Slaughter, Christopher and McKeon, Devon and Zhou, Ziyu and Jacob, Robert J.
