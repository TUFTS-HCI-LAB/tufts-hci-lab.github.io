The high density fNIRS equipment in Hirshfield’s lab provides rich spatio-temporal data that is well suited as input into deep neural networks and other advanced machine learning algorithms. A primary tenet of Hirshfield’s machine learning research involves building and labeling large cross-participant, cross-task fNIRS training datasets in order to build robust and generalizable models that can avoid overfitting and succeed in ecologically valid environments outside the lab.")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"research-interests"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#research-interests"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" Research interests")]),e._v(" "),a("p",[e._v("human-computer interaction")]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"home-page"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#home-page"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" "),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://www.colorado.edu/ics/leanne-hirshfield",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Home Page"),a("OutboundLink")],1)]),e._v(" "),a("h2",{attrs:{id:"google-scholar"}},[a("a",{staticClass:"header-anchor",attrs:{href:"#google-scholar"}},[e._v("#")]),e._v(" "),a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5H_nV8cAAAAJ",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"}},[e._v("Google Scholar"),a("OutboundLink")],1)])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);a.default=s.exports}}]);
