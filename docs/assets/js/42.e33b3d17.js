She found and directs the Wellesley College Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab. Her research focuses on next generation user interfaces including virtual and augmented reality, tangible, gestural, tactile, and multi touch interaction. Current projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and by industry grants include the design and evaluation of novel human-machine interfaces for supporting productivity in highly-automated vehicles, the development of new interactive visualizations for personal -omics, and the conceptualization and prototyping of computational tools for enhancing learning and innovation in bio-design. Shaer received her PhD and MSc in Computer Science from Tufts University.
