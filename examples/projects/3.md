## Overview
---

<img src="/project_images/tern/tangk.jpg" style='float:right;'>

Tern is a tangible computer language designed to provide a painless introduction to computer programming for children in educational settings. With Tern you can create programs for robots like the LEGO Mindstorms RCX or the iRobot Create. Tern is featured in a permanent exhibit at the [Boston Museum of Science](http://www.mos.org/) called [Robot Park](http://hci.cs.tufts.edu/tern/robotpark.html). It is also being used for the [Tangible Kindergarten](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~mhorn01/tangk.html) project at the Tufts University [Developmental Technologies](http://ase.tufts.edu/devtech) group.

## Programming with Wooden Blocks
---

<img src="/project_images/tern/robot.jpg" style='float:right;'>

To create programs with Tern, you don't use a mouse or keyboard. Instead, Tern allows you to create physical computer programs using interlocking wooden blocks that represent actions for your robot to perform. With Tern there is no such thing as a syntax error. The shape of the interlocking blocks creates physical syntax that prevents the creation of invalid programs. Tern programs can be compiled in a matter of seconds with the press of a button.

## How It Works

Tern's wooden blocks contain no embedded electronics or power supplies. Instead Tern uses a standard webcam connected to a desktop or laptop computer to take a picture of your program, which it then converts into digital code using the [TopCodes computer vision library](http://hci.cs.tufts.edu/topcodes).

## People
--- 

Tern was created by [Michael Horn](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~mhorn01) at the Tufts University. It is currently being developed as part of an NSF-funded collaboration between the Tufts [Developmental Technologies Research Group](http://ase.tufts.edu/devtech) and the Tufts [Human Computer Interaction Lab](http://hci.cs.tufts.edu/). Tern's team members include:

- [Michael Horn](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~mhorn01), Tufts HCI Lab
- [Erin Solovey](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~etreac01), Tufts HCI Lab
- [Jordan Crouser](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~rcrous01), Tufts HCI Lab
- [Robert Jacob](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob), Tufts HCI Lab
