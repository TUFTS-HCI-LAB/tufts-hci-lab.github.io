## BIO
He received my PhD in Computer Science from Tufts University in 2019, studying Brain-Computer Interfaces at the intersection of data mining, human-computer interaction, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and music. He has a ten year history writing algorithms that classify mental states from neuroimaging data, as well as developing user interfaces that support data mining and running experiments for BCI. His dissertation describes a physical paradigm for measuring the relative information load of data entering the brain through sensation versus ideas originating from internal storage spaces by detecting anti-correlated networks using fNIRS.
