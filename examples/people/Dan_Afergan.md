## BIO
He is a software engineer at Google (YouTube) interested in adaptive user interfaces and human performance. He completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Tufts University with Professor Robert Jacob at the Tufts Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab, focusing on brain-computer interfaces and using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for adaptive systems. He also studied visualization and collaborated with the Visual Analytics Lab at Tufts.

He graduated from from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in Cognitive Science with minors in Psychology & Computer Science and Engineering in 2005. He received an M.S. in Computer Science from The George Washington University in 2009.

From 2005 to 2010 I worked at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in the Warfighter Human System Integration Laboratory, working on immersive virtual environment training systems for Marine Corps infantry training and researching physiological measurements of performance.
