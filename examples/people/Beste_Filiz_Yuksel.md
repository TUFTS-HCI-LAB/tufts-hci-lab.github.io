## BIO
She is a fifth year tenure track Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department at the University of San Francisco. She has created the Human-Computer Interaction teaching and research programs here at USF. She is the founder and director of the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Lab where she carries out research into brain-computer interfaces and virtual reality. She received the National Science Foundation CISE Research Infrastructure Award in 2017. She is the Faculty Advisor for the Women in Tech initiative at USF and she helped create the Diversineers student organization. She has a high proportion of women and minorities from underrepresented groups in her research lab, as well as military veterans. Her work has won awards in the top publication venue in her field.


## Research interests
Her Human-Computer Interaction research lab focuses on two branches of research: 1) full body visuomotor synchrony in virtual reality and investigating the effects of this on implicit biases, and 2) using brain-computer interfaces, specifically using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to detect, analyze, and respond to brain signals in real time using machine learning and deep learning techniques. In addition, we use physiological and affective computing as well as paradigms based in cognitive psychology to build models of user state. These user models provide the computer with an increased knowledge of the user, thus allowing for a more intelligent, personalized and adaptive response from the computer to the human.
