## BIO
Her research is in human-computer interaction. One focus of her research is on next-generation interaction techniques, such as brain-computer interfaces, physiological computing, and reality-based interaction. She designs, builds and evaluates interactive computing systems that use machine learning approaches to adapt and support the userâ€™s changing cognitive state and context. She also investigates novel paradigms for designing with accessibility in mind, particularly for the Deaf community. Much of her work also explores effective human interaction with complex and autonomous systems and vehicles. Her work has applications in areas such as education, transportation, medicine, creativity support, gaming, and complex decision making.
